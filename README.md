Hello, and thank you for your interest in joining our team!

We appreciate you devoting some of your time to this test. It should not take more than 2 hours. We use the test to confirm your skills and abilities, so please make sure to give it your best.

So let's get started!

For the test we've created:

1. A dummy react app - that's these files.
2. UI mockups - Available at https://www.figma.com/file/JvgHqLBjyreJGl90m3OB0z/UI-Test?node-id=0%3A1 . If you don't already have a Figma account, we recommend creating a free Starter one as it will allow you to more fully inspect the mockups.
3. A prototype of how the app UI is expected to look and function - Available at https://www.figma.com/proto/JvgHqLBjyreJGl90m3OB0z/UI-Test?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=7%3A17719&viewport=345%2C48%2C0.5&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=7%3A17719&hide-ui=1
4. A video walkthrough letting you know what's expected. - Make sure to watch this.

Upon running the app you will notice it does not fully match the look and behavior of the prototype. For this test your job is to show off your skills by making it match (exactly).

Once you're done, zip up the files and send them back so we can review your handiwork.

Below are instructions on how to run this React app, and everything else you need is listed above (make sure to watch the video). We wish you the best of luck. Have fun!
