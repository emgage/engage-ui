# Button group

Button group displays multiple related actions in a row to help with horizontal
arrangement and the spacing of calls to action.

**Problem**

Merchants need to understand when a set of actions are related so they can take
the appropriate next step.

**Solution**

Button group lays out a set of buttons horizontally as a set and lets them wrap
if necessary.

## Best practices

Button groups should:

* Only use buttons that follow the
[best practices outlined in the button component](component/button)
* Group together calls to action that have a relationship
* Be used with consideration that too many calls to action can cause merchants
to be unsure of what to do next
* Be thoughtful about how multiple horizontally placed buttons will look and work
on small screens
* Only be used in groups of up to six buttons if the buttons contain an icon
with no text

## Examples

### Default button group

Use when you have multiple buttons to space them out evenly.

```jsx
<ButtonGroup>
  <Button>Button 1</Button>
  <Button>Button 2</Button>
</ButtonGroup>
```

### Button group with segmented buttons

Use to emphasize several buttons as a thematically-related set among other controls.

```jsx
<ButtonGroup segmented>
  <Button>Button 1</Button>
  <Button>Button 2</Button>
</ButtonGroup>
```
